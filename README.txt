In order to try the different embodiements, open the "Hand examples" scene in the "Scenes" folder. 

Here are the commands to use it: 

	Space: change to the next dimorphism mode
	M: Put the scene in full screen or leave full screen
	C: For the 6th finger embodiement, change the retargetting matching (there is two different retargetting which can be applied, which will be choose during the experiment corresponding to what the user will need to touch during the task.)

Advice: 
	
	You can use the leap motion only to try it, but try to keep it around your face position (the postion it will be positionned to when we will use HMD), if not the tracking quality is lowered.
